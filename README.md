# 🔗 RL Nexus (The Social Link Hub)

**RL Nexus** is a lightweight, serverless identity hub designed to solve the "fragmented profile" problem. 

Instead of relying on third-party subscriptions (like Linktree), RL Nexus uses **Python and Streamlit** to generate self-contained "Magic Links." All user data (bio, image, links) is compressed and encoded directly into the URL string, meaning no database is required for the MVP.
